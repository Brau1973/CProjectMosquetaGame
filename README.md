# CProjectMosquetaGame
My first development project at the university, developed with C.
This Project was developed in 2018 without the knowledge of GIT, so there is no history of commits and pushs...

The project is based on the well-know game "Mosqueta". In the game you have X quantity of cups and a hidden rock on one of them, so you make a bet and try to guess where the rock is, if you are right you win money.
