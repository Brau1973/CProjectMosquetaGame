# CProjectMosquetaGame
My first development project at the university, developed with C/C++, a console APP.
This Project was developed in 2018 without the knowledge of GIT, so there is no history of commits and pushs...

The project is based on the well-know game "Mosqueta". In the game you have X quantity of cups and a hidden rock on one of them, so you make a bet and try to guess where the rock is, if you are right you win money.

## Objective:
The goal of develop this project was the use of the principles of programming, such as:
  </br>
  -If/Else
  </br>
  -While
  </br>
  -Do While
  </br>
  -Switch
  </br>
  -Arrays
  </br>
  -Sorting algorithms
  </br>
  -Algorithms and logical thinking
  </br>
  -Functions
  </br>
  -Customize data types (structs)
  </br>

## Functionalities:
  -Sign Up
  </br>
  -Log In
  </br>
  -Log Out
  </br>
  -Play
  </br>
  -History of user last 3 matches
  </br>
  -Ranking of top 5 Best matches (of all registered users)
  </br>
  -The program cheat you in some turns...
  </br>
  
  ## Want to try it in Linux?:
  Run in terminal:
  </br>
  sudo apt-get -y update  (This command will allow to update the libraries in the S.O. repositories.)
  </br>
  sudo apt-get -y upgrade  (Update the programs to their latest version.)
  </br>
  sudo apt-get install build-essential  (It will install the GCC compiler and other development tools.)
  </br>
  g++ -o mosqueta MosquetaGame.cpp
  </br>
  ./mosqueta
